Intro to JS
- JS (Behavioral)
- CSS (Presentational)
- HTML (Structural)
- It's like building a house
  - CSS - fixtures, carpeting, paint
  - JS - electrical, plumbing, HVAC
  - HTML - framing, flooring, drywall
  - Server - foundation

Basic Variables
Variables - the nouns of programming, they are "things" (numbers, strings, booleans (true/false), etc.), composed of variable names and values
!- before a variable makes the variable return the opposite

Concatination - adding strings together

Console.log is a quick expression used to print content to the debugger.
  - it is very useful to troubleshoot
  - much easier way to see that your form is doing what you are expecting it to do.

Alert- ok prompt
Confirm- ok or cancel prompt
Prompt- ask for some sort of information to be entered, will always be returned as a string

Document.Write

If-Then Statements
- Super critical
- Each statement is composed of an if, else-if, or else (keyword), a condition, and the resulting code in {}.

== checks for the value, allows for coersion
=== checks for the type, has to match exactly to return true

Arrays
- Zebra(0), Rhino(1), Giraffe(2), Owl(3) - (indexes)
  - var zooAnimals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl"]

What we will do today:
- Array Assignments
- Concept of For-Loops
  - Loops- I want you to do the same thing over again until I say stop. (repetitive tasks)
- The art of psuedo coding
  - if you can't explain the coding in words then you won't be able to do the actual coding
  - the exercise of saying what is my code going to do and write it out in words
- Building Rock Paper Scissors
  - last 30 minutes will be building this basic rock paper scissors app

What is JS?
- Every time you see something on a website that happens without refreshing the page is JS.
- Allows dev to create dynamic websites.
- declaring a variable
  - var
  - var name (var x) - there are certain words that it cannot be (basically any word that is used in JS to perform soemthing)
  - =
  - value
  - semicolon

What is meant by console.log?
- alert - var x = alert();
- prompt - prompt();
- confirm - confirm ();
- document.write -

What is an array?
- collection of variables
- can be string, numbers, booleans, etc.

For Loops
- for (var i = 0; i < vegetable.length; i++) { console.log("I love" + vegetable[i])};
  - iterator - first statement in the loop will only run one time
  - condition - second statement goes through the array until it's not true starting at 0
  - implimentation - third statement adds one to the last item of the array
